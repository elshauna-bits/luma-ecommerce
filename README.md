#How to execute
The first test to be executed is the signUp.e2e.js. Information for a new user is already in the function. After this test is run add an x to the it block (it should look like this xit) so that the test cannot be executed again. 

After creating a new user, head to the checkoutFlow.e2e.js, a product will be added to the cart, purchased and verified.
